transmission-dsl5028en
------------

Transmission BitTorrent client for the Aztech DSL5028EN (1T1R) Linux wireless router.

**Currently Transmission does not start because I haven't been able to compile it statically.** cURL and OpenSSL work, though.

Built using a MIPS32 GCC 4.8.5 toolchain with uClibc 0.9.33.2.
